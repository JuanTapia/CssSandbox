    <h1>The Swiss Family Robinson:
        The Boa Constrictor 
        </h1>
    <p>
        What would you do if a humongous boa constrictor was at your house trying to eat you and your family? Without human contact for many months, a family from Switzerland is struggling to build a new life on an island that no one has ever been to since they got shipwrecked. They have had to build a house up in the trees, train wild animals to aid them in their work, and fend off savage beasts to protect themselves. On one such occasion they had to fight and kill an extremely large boa constrictor, larger than any seen before. <u>In The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann Wyss</u>, I found chapter eleven interesting because it was shocking, exciting, and sad.

        First, this scene from the lives of the family that has been stranded on an island, was shocking, because of the size of this animal and what it did. This Boa was none like any ever seen by man. When it reared its head it was twenty feet tall, which is as tall as two elephants. And that wasn’t even half of it! What it did was much worse. It ate the family’s donkey. Could you even imagine having your pet eaten in front of you?

        Next, this event with the boa constrictor was exciting for a few reasons. The mother commanded calmly that everyone go to the salt cave at the center of the island, for the safety of the family. When the father and Franz went to check on the animals and they didn’t come back right away, the little brother, Jack, started to cry quietly because the mother told him to be silent. He was crying because he was afraid that Father and Franz were going to be eaten. Eventually they came back, but Father wouldn’t go more than 100 feet from the mouth of the cave.

        Lastly, this part of the story was particularly sad. Since the donkey was eaten, the family did not have a work animal to help gather food and resources. 
And what made the story so much more sad was that the donkey was so afraid that it actually ran towards the Boa. In the end they had to kill the boa so that they could feel safe from future attacks.

        I chose this part of the book, <u> The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann Wyss</u>, because it was very shocking that there could be an animal of that size in the 1900s. Also in the weeks that the Boa was around, was both exciting and scary how the family was too afraid to do anything. And in the end it was still a very sad story on the family’s side and the Boa’s side.
